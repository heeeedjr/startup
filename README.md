# CS 260 Start Up Application Project

## Lessons Learned
- I learned more about how to resolve merge conflicts. Usually, I do everything through the CLI, which can be a pain, but using the GitLens extension on VSCode made it quite easy to resolve without completely overwriting one of the commits. 


## Start up Pitch
- I will create an interactive blog website to track my journey with Information Technology (IT). It will provide funny misconceptions I had, common problems when first starting, personal goals for my career, and commentary on the current state of all things cyber. The blog will be a place where any beginner in IT can go to feel comfortable and understood. It will be well designed and maintained by me as an example of how far I have come. If users wish to comment on the blog posts, they must create an account. There will be some fun small features like using dad joke/funny quote APIs to pre-fill the comment section among other ideas. Here is the inital ideas regarding the layout of the website.
