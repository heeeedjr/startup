# CS 260 Start Up Application Project

## Lessons Learned
- I learned more about how to resolve merge conflicts. Usually, I do everything through the CLI, which can be a pain, but using the GitLens extension on VSCode made it quite easy to resolve without completely overwriting one of the commits. 


## Start up Pitch
- I will create an interactive blog website to track my journey with Information Technology (IT). It will provide funny misconceptions I had, common problems when first starting, personal goals for my career, and commentary on the current state of all things cyber. The blog will be a place where any beginner in IT can go to feel comfortable and understood. It will be well designed and maintained by me as an example of how far I have come. If users wish to comment on the blog posts, they must create an account. There will be some fun small features like using dad joke/funny quote APIs to pre-fill the comment section among other ideas.  

## Key Features
- Secure login over HTTPS
- OAuth 2.0 with Facebook and Google
- Ability to comment on blog posts when logged in
- Several web pages including about the author, featured posts, all posts, etc.
- Search bar for easy navigation
- Comments and posts are stored in database for persistant storage
- Admin can create, update, and delete blog posts and comments on the posts
